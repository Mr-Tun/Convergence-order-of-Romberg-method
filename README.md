# Convergence-order-of-Romberg-method

Romberg's method is a Newton–Cotes formula – it evaluates the integrand at equally spaced points. The integrand must have continuous derivatives, though fairly good results may be obtained if only a few derivatives exist. If it is possible to evaluate the integrand at unequally spaced points, then other methods such as Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature are generally more accurate.

The method is named after Werner Romberg (1909–2003), who published the method in 1955.

This program not only uses Romberg's method to integrate functions by trapezoidal recursion, but also to determine whether the function being integrated is a bad function (i.e. whether the convergence order of the function being integrated and the theory match)
